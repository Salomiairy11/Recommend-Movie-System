# Recommend Movie System ðŸŽ¬

This project implements a **Content-Based Filtering** movie recommendation system. It suggests movies to users based on the features of the movies themselves, such as genre, director, cast, and keywords from plot descriptions. The goal is to recommend movies that are similar to those the user has liked or shown interest in.
